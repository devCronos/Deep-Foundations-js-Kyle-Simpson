# Conceptual Aside
## Classical vs Prototypal Inheritance
* With Object Oriented JavaScript we will focus on the creation of objects
    - That's where a majority of confusion arises

## Inheritance
One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object

* Lots of examples use animals and cars but let's keep it super simple

## What is Classical Inheritance?
* It is present in C#, Java
* It is popular
* It is a way of sharing properties and methods
* It is the most popular way where its been done for a long time
* It is not bad
* But thinking it is the only approach is wrong
* Thinking it has no downsides is wrong

## Cons of Classical Inheritance
* It is verbose
* They grow large and it becomes hard to figure out how one works with another
* It's like a house that gets so large when you change a lightbulb the toilet flushes
    - Lots of keywords flying around like:
        + friend
        + protected
        + private
        + interface
        + You have to learn what they all mean
        + and try to use them

## What is Prototypal Inheritance?
* Much Simpler
* Flexible
* Extensible
* Very easy to understand
