# Conceptual Aside
* name/value pairs
* objects

In JavaScript objects are super, super, super important

## name/value pair
A name which maps to a unique value

* The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given context (_We are talking about execution context_)
    - In the execution context, the code that is running the **name** can only be defined with `one` **value**
* That value may be more name/value pairs

### Example of name/value pair
`Address = '100 Main St.'`

* We will use name/value pairs to define **objects**

## Object
A collection of name value pairs

* The simplest definition when talking about JavaScript
* Other program languages may have difference concepts when they talk about objects but with JavaScript that is what they are

### Code Example of Object

* We have an object with a collection of `name/value` pairs
* Don't think any more deeply about objects in JavaScript than this
    - You have an object and nested inside it can have name value pairs or it can have other objects nested inside with their own name/value pairs
