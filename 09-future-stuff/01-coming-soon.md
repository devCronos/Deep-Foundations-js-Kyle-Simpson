# Future JavaScript Stuff

## Typescript
[link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

* Provides `types` for your variables
* So if you want to specify what type your variables should be, you can do that with Typescript

* Click Playground

## Traceur
[link](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler)

* Let's you write ES6 today
* It will transpile it into ES5
* [Demo link to practice Traceur](https://google.github.io/traceur-compiler/demo/repl.html#)
* Teams are using this to write ES6 now and then down the road they can stop using traceur and just use ES6

## Transpiled Languages
### Transpile
Convert the syntax of one programming language, to another

* In this case languages that don't really ever run anywhere, but instead are processed by 'transpilers' that generate JavaScript
* You can use Typescript and type in that and than transpile it into ES5 JavaScript
