# Primitive Types
* A type of data that represents a single value
    - In other words, something that is not an object

## Object
A collection of name/value pairs

## A Primitive Type
A single value

## There are 6 types of Primitives in JavaScript
1. Undefined
2. Null
3. Boolean
4. Number
5. String
6. Symbol (new)

### 1. Undefined
* `undefined` represents a lack of existence
* (_you shouldn't set a variable to this_)
* The JavaScript Engine initially sets variables to this value and it will stay `undefined` unless you set the variable to have a value

### 2. Null
* `null` represents lack of existence
* Developers should use this when setting a variable to not having a value

### 3. Boolean
true or false

### 4. Number
* Only one numeric type in JavaScript and it is called `Number`
* `Number` is a **Floating point** number (meaning there is always some decimals)
* Unlike other programming languages (they have `integer`, `decimal`...), there is only one `number` type... and that can make math weird

### 5. String
* A sequence of characters
* both single quotes `''` and double quotes can be used `""`

### 6. Symbol (new)
Used in ES6 - won't talk about it in this course
